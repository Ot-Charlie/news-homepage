## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned
This project was really impactful in making me understand the workings of grid. I had become very dependent on flex, but this project made me see the technicality and advantages of grid in the right situation. I also learnt how to deal with in-line elements as they do not follow the regular rules of block. I learnt how to make a functional popup menu.

### Continued development
I want to continue developing my javascript skills as well as knowing how to debug properly. I also want to improve on the time it takes me to turn out projects.


### Useful resources


Claude AI was very useful in providing refreshers for areas which were grey to me.
